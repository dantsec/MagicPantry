> Magic Pantry: Discover what to cook with what you have. Unlock the magic of your pantry with this tool! Let us reveal the possibilities hidden in your ingredients, turning them into delicious meals.

- **Magic Pantry** is a funny and useful culinary chatbot that uses AI techniques ([**_zero-shot_** + **_chain of thought_**](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot.en#zero-shot-cot-prompting)) to help users find recipes based on the ingredients they have at your pantry. Identifies ingredients, searches for compatible recipes, considers restrictions and preferences and presents suggestions in an organized way. The objective is to show to user how it is possible to make a tasty meal even with few resources.
